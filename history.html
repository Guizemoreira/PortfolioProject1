                    <strong>Cruzeiro Esporte Clube</strong> (Brazilian Portuguese: [kɾuˈzejɾu esˈpoɾtʃi ˈklubi]), known
                    simply as Cruzeiro, is a Brazilian
                    sports club based in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Although they compete in a number of different
                    sports, Cruzeiro is
                    mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B, the
                    second tier of the
                    Brazilian football league system, as well as in the Campeonato Mineiro, the state of Minas Gerais's
                    premier state
                    league. It’s the biggest club in the state, followed by rivals Atlético MG and America. <br><br>

                    The club was founded on 2 January 1921, by sportsmen from the Italian colony of Belo Horizonte, some
                    members of Yale
                    Atlético Clube and many Italian immigrant workers decided to create a new club called Societá
                    Sportiva Ypiranga,
                    changing the name months later to Palestra Mineiro and after one game to Palestra Itália. As a
                    result of the Second
                    World War, the Brazilian federal government banned the use of any symbols referring to the Axis
                    powers in 1942. The club
                    board members rebaptized the club with the name of a leading national symbol: the Cruzeiro do Sul's
                    constellation.
                    Cruzeiro play their home games at the Mineirão stadium, which currently holds up to 62,547
                    spectators. Cruzeiro's
                    regular kit colors are blue shirts and white shorts with white socks. <br><br>

                    Cruzeiro is one of Brazil's most successful clubs despite its relatively young age (compared with
                    other major Brazilian
                    clubs). It won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A for the first time in 1966, after defeating Santos'
                    Os Santásticos in
                    the final series. Cruzeiro has won the Brasileirão again in 2003, 2013 and 2014, obtaining the best
                    campaign in the
                    present format of the competition. Cruzeiro has also won record six Copa do Brasil titles and the
                    Campeonato Mineiro 39
                    times. Cruzeiro won the defunct state competitions Taça Minas Gerais five times, the Copa dos
                    Campeões Mineiros twice,
                    Copa Sul Minas twice, the Torneio Início 10 times and the Supercampeonato Mineiro once. The Raposa
                    (The Fox), when referring
                    to Cruzeiro's mascot as the team symbol, also obtained many international laurels such as two Copa
                    Libertadores, two Supercopa Libertadores, one Recopa Sudamericana, one Copa de
                    Oro and one Copa Master de Supercopa. Cruzeiro is one of the two Brazilian clubs to complete the
                    Domestic Treble, a feat
                    accomplished in 2003 after winning the Campeonato Mineiro, the 2003 Copa do Brasil and the 2003
                    Brasileirão. <br><br>

                    Cruzeiro hold a long-standing rivalry against Atlético Mineiro. It has contributed many key and
                    famous players towards
                    Brazil's FIFA World Cup squads such as Piazza, Tostão, Nelinho, Ronaldo, Luisão, Alex, Maicon, Cris,
                    Jairzinho and Rivaldo
                    among so many others. <br><br>

                    Cruzeiro was relegated to Brazilian Série B for the first time in history on 8 December 2019, after
                    losing to Palmeiras
                    with the score of 2–0 at home.<br><br>
